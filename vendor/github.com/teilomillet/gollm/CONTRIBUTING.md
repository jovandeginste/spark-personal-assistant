# Contributing to gollm

Welcome to gollm! We're excited that you're interested in contributing. This guide aims to make your contribution experience smooth and enjoyable.

## Our Philosophy

- **Simplicity is key**: We believe in clear, readable code that speaks for itself.
- **Learn by example**: New features should come with well-commented examples.
- **Open to all**: Whether you're fixing a typo, adding a new provider or implementing a major feature, your contribution is valuable. (thank you !)

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes**:
   - Focus on a single purpose per commit.
   - Ensure your code is readable and well-commented.
   - Add examples for new features.
3. **Test your changes** to make sure everything works as expected.
   - `go test -v (go list ./... | grep -v /examples)`
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear title and description.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple**: Aim for clear, concise code that others can easily understand.
- **Comment your code**: Explain the 'why' behind complex logic.
- **Write examples**: For new features, include a simple example of how to use it.
- **Follow Go conventions**: Use `gofmt` to format your code.
